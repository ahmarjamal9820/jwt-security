## Introduction

This project provides a solid foundation for implementing stateless authentication using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** in Spring Boot applications. It supports both:

- **Access Tokens** – short-lived for protected endpoints  
- **Refresh Tokens** – longer-lived to renew access without re-login

Perfect for REST APIs that demand both security and scalability.
